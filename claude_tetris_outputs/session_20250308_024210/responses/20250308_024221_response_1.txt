I don't see a Tetris game in the provided image - it appears to be a Windows desktop with various application icons. The image shows a blue Windows wallpaper with desktop shortcuts including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Discord, and other applications.

Please provide an actual screenshot of the Tetris game in progress, showing the current board state and falling piece, so I can analyze it and generate the appropriate PyAutoGUI code.
