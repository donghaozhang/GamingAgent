I don't see a Tetris game in the provided image. The image shows a Windows desktop with various application icons like Google Chrome, Discord, Microsoft Edge, and others, along with a blue wallpaper design. 

To provide PyAutoGUI code to control Tetris, I would need to see the actual Tetris game board with the current piece and board state. Could you please share an image that shows the active Tetris game?
