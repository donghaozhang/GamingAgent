I don't see a Tetris game in the provided image. The image shows a Windows desktop with various application icons. There is no Tetris board visible that I can analyze.

If you could provide an image that shows the actual Tetris game, I'd be happy to analyze the board state and generate PyAutoGUI code to control the current piece.
