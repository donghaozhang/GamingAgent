```python
# Current piece is I-piece (cyan/light blue), next piece is O-piece (yellow)
# Best strategy is to place the I-piece on the right side to clear the gap

# Move the I-piece to the right side where there's a gap
import pyautogui
import time

# Move right 5 times to position the I-piece correctly
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.1)

# Drop the piece immediately to fill the gap
pyautogui.press("space")
