```python

import time

# Current piece: T-piece (purple)
# Next piece: Z-piece (red)
# Strategy: Move the T-piece to the left to help build a flat structure and prepare for the Z-piece

# Move T-piece to the left (currently at center, move 3 positions left)
pyautogui.press("left")
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("left")
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("left")
time.sleep(0.1)

# Rotate T-piece once clockwise to have flat side down
pyautogui.press("up")
time.sleep(0.1)

# Drop the piece immediately
pyautogui.press("space")
