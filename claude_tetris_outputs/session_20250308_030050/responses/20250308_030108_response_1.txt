```python
import pyautogui
import time

# We have a T-shape piece (purple) at the top and a I-shape piece (cyan) coming next
# Since the board is empty, let's place the T-piece flat to create a strong foundation

# Move the T-piece to the left side of the board
pyautogui.press("left")  # Move left once
pyautogui.press("left")  # Move left twice
pyautogui.press("left")  # Move left three times

# Rotate the T-piece to have the flat side down
pyautogui.press("up")    # Rotate once

# Drop the piece immediately
pyautogui.press("space") # Drop the piece
```
