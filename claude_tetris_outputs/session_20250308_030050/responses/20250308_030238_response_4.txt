Looking at the current Tetris board, I can see a Z piece (red) at the top, and the next piece is an I piece (cyan). The board has some purple blocks on the left side and cyan blocks on the right side at the bottom.

```python
import pyautogui
import time

# Add a small delay before starting
time.sleep(0.1)

# Move the Z piece to fit nicely on the right side
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)

# Rotate the Z piece once to match orientation
pyautogui.press("up")
time.sleep(0.05)

# Drop the piece into position
pyautogui.press("space")
```

This code will move the Z piece to the right side, rotate it once to fit vertically, and drop it in place. This creates a good spot for the upcoming I piece and avoids creating holes.
