```python
import pyautogui
import time

# Current piece is a cyan I-block at the top
# Next piece is a purple T-piece
# There's a purple L-block at the bottom left
# Strategy: Place I-block flat on the right side of the L-block to keep the stack balanced

# Wait briefly to ensure the game registers commands
time.sleep(0.1)

# Move I-block right three times to position it to the right of the L-block
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)
pyautogui.press("right")
time.sleep(0.05)

# Rotate the I-block to horizontal orientation
pyautogui.press("up")
time.sleep(0.05)

# Drop the piece immediately to the bottom
pyautogui.press("space")
