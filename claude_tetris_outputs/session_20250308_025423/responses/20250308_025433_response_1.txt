```python
import pyautogui
import time

# Current piece is a T piece at the top
# Next piece is an I piece (horizontal line)
# For the T piece, best to place it flat side down to avoid creating gaps

# Move the T piece to the left to create a flat surface
pyautogui.press("left")
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("left")
time.sleep(0.1)

# Rotate the T piece once to have flat side down
pyautogui.press("up")
time.sleep(0.1)

# Drop the piece immediately
pyautogui.press("space")
