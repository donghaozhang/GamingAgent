Analyzing the Tetris board, I see a blue I-piece (straight tetromino) currently falling at the top. The next piece is a yellow O-piece (square tetromino). The board has a somewhat uneven stack with some gaps.

```python
import pyautogui
import time

# Add a small delay before starting to ensure the game is in focus
time.sleep(0.5)

# Move the I-piece to the right side to fill the column gap
pyautogui.press("right")
pyautogui.press("right")
pyautogui.press("right")
pyautogui.press("right")

# Drop the piece immediately to place it vertically on the right side
pyautogui.press("space")
```
