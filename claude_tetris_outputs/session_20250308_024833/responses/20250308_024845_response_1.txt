```python
import pyautogui
import time

# Current piece is a blue I-tetromino at the top
# Next piece is a yellow square (O-tetromino)
# Best move: Position the I-tetromino to fill the gap at column 5

# Move to the right position (column 5)
pyautogui.press("right")  # Move right once from starting position
time.sleep(0.1)

# Drop the piece immediately to fill the gap
pyautogui.press("space")  # Hard drop

# This placement will keep the stack relatively balanced and sets up
# for the next yellow square piece which can be placed on the right side
