Looking at the current board state, I can see we have an I-piece (long blue tetromino) at the top. The next piece will be a square (yellow) tetromino. I'll position the current I-piece to create the most balanced board possible.

```python
import pyautogui
import time

# Wait a moment before starting
time.sleep(0.5)

# Move I-piece to the right side to fill the gap at column 7-8
pyautogui.press("right")  # Move right once
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("right")  # Move right twice
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("right")  # Move right three times
time.sleep(0.1)
pyautogui.press("up")     # Rotate the I-piece to horizontal position
time.sleep(0.1)

# Drop the piece into position
pyautogui.press("space")  # Hard drop
```
