Analyze the current Tetris board state and generate PyAutoGUI code to control Tetris 
for the next {plan_seconds} second(s). You can move left/right, rotate pieces. Focus on clearing lines and avoiding 
stacking that would cause a top-out.

At the time the code is executed, 3~5 seconds have elapsed. The game might have moved on to the next block if the stack is high.

However, in your code, consider only the current block or the next block.

The speed it drops is at around ~0.75s/grid bock.

### General Tetris Controls (example keybinds):
- left: move piece left
- right: move piece right
- up: rotate piece clockwise
- down: accelerated drop ï¼ˆif necessary)

### Strategies and Caveats:
1. If the stack is high, most likely you are controlling the "next" block due to latency.
2. Prioritize keeping the stack flat. Balance the two sides.
3. Consider shapes ahead of time. DO NOT rotate and quickly move the block again once it's position is decided.
4. Avoid creating holes.
5. If you see a chance to clear lines, rotate and move the block to correct positions.
6. Plan for your next piece as well, but do not top out.
7. The entire sequence of key presses should be feasible within {plan_seconds} second(s).

### Output Format:
- Output ONLY the Python code for PyAutoGUI commands, e.g. `pyautogui.press("left")`.
- Include brief comments for each action.
- Do not print anything else besides these Python commands.
