# Social App Prototype

A high-fidelity prototype for a social media application that combines features from Bilibili and Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book). This prototype is created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and FontAwesome icons to provide a realistic, interactive UI for development purposes.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach simulating iPhone 15 Pro dimensions
- **Modern UI**: Clean, flat design following iOS design guidelines
- **Interactive Elements**: Clickable tabs and navigation
- **Multiple Screens**: Complete user journey with different app sections

## Screens

1. **Home Feed** (`home.html`): Main content feed showcasing posts from users with videos and images
2. **Explore** (`explore.html`): Discovery page with content arranged in a grid layout
3. **Create** (`create.html`): Content creation page with image/video upload and editing options
4. **Notifications** (`notifications.html`): Activity feed showing interactions from other users
5. **Profile** (`profile.html`): User profile page displaying user stats and content

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Navigate between screens using the bottom tab bar or the buttons at the top of the viewer
3. Interact with the UI elements to explore the prototype

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **FontAwesome**: Icons for UI elements
- **CSS3**: Custom styling and animations
- **iframes**: For embedding multiple screens in a single view

## Design Considerations

- **Combined Features**: Incorporates video content (Bilibili-style) with image-based posts (Xiaohongshu-style)
- **User Experience**: Focus on content discovery and social interaction
- **Aesthetics**: Modern, clean design with attention to detail
- **Accessibility**: Proper use of semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

## Future Enhancements

- Add JavaScript functionality for fully interactive prototype
- Implement dark mode theme
- Add more screens (settings, chat, etc.)
- Create transitions between screens
