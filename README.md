## Introduction

The goal of this repo is to provide an easy solution of deploying computer use agents (CUAs) that run on your PC and laptops. As part of LMGames, our current focus is on building local gaming agents.

Current features:

- Gaming agents for Platformer and Atari games.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent.git
cd GamingAgent
```
2. Install dependency:
```
conda create -n game_cua python==3.10 -y
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## APIs

Currently we support gaming agents based on the following models:

- OpenAI:
  - gpt-4o
  - gpt-4o-mini
  - o1
- Anthropic:
  - claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
  - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219
- Gemini:
  - gemini-1.5-pro
  - gemini-1.5-flash (for Tetris)
- OpenRouter:
  - anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet:thinking (for enhanced reasoning)
  - Any other model available on OpenRouter

Set your API keys with:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY}
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY={YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
export GEMINI_API_KEY={your_GEMINI_API_KEY}
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY={your_OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to concurrency, deploying the agent with high-end models (and a large number of workers) could incur higher cost.

#### Model-Specific Considerations

- **Claude Models**: Require proper base64 image encoding with the correct content format.
- **Gemini Models**: The Flash variant provides faster responses for real-time gaming.
- **OpenAI Models**: Offer good performance across most games with varying latency/quality trade-offs.
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Access to specialized model variants like Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking) for enhanced reasoning capabilities.

## Games

### Super Mario Bros (1985 by Nintendo)

#### Game Installation

Install your Super Mario Bros game. In our demo, we adopt [SuperMarioBros-C](https://github.com/MitchellSternke/SuperMarioBros-C).

Navigate to the repo and follow the installation instructions.

#### Launch Gaming Agent

1. Once the game is built, download and move the ROM file:
```
mv path-to-your-ROM-file/"Super Mario Bros. (JU) (PRG0) [!].nes" $YOUR_WORKPLACE/SuperMarioBros-C/build/
```

2. Launch the game with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/SuperMarioBros-C/build
./smbc
```

3. Full screen the game by pressing `F`. You should be able to see:

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/super_mario_bros/home.png" alt="super_mario" width="400" align="center">
</p>

4. Open another screen, launch your agent in terminal with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/GamingAgent
python games/superMario/mario_agent.py --api_provider {your_favorite_api_provider} --model_name {official_model_codename}
```

5. Due to concurrency issue, sometimes the agent will temporarily pause your game by pressing `Enter`. To avoid the issue, you can launch the agent only after entering the game upon seeing:

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/super_mario_bros/level_1.png" alt="super_mario_level_1" width="400" align="center">
</p>

#### Other command options
```
--concurrency_interval: Interval in seconds between starting workers.

--api_response_latency_estimate: Estimated API response latency in seconds.

--policy: 'long', 'short', 'alternate' or 'mixed'. In 'long' or 'short' modes only those workers are enabled.
```

#### Build your own policy


You can implement your own policy in `mario_agent.py`! Deploying high-concurrency strategy with short-term planning streaming workers vs. low-concurrency strategy with long-term planning workers, or a mix of both.

In our early experiments, 'alternate' policy performs well. Try it yourself and find out which one works better!

### 2048

2048 is a sliding tile puzzle game where players merge numbered tiles to reach the highest possible value. In our demo, we adopt and modify [2048-Pygame](https://github.com/rajitbanerjee/2048-pygame) 

#### Game Set Up

Run the 2048 game with a defined window size:
```sh
python games/game_2048/game_logic.py -wd 600 -ht 600
```
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/2048/2048_sample.png" alt="2048" width="400" align="center">
</p>

Use **Ctrl** to restart the game and the **arrow keys** to move tiles strategically.

Start the AI agent to play automatically:

```sh
python games/game_2048/2048_agent.py
```


#### Other command options
```
--api_provider: API provider to use.

--model_name: Model name (has to come with vision capability).

```


### Tetris

#### Game Installation

Install your Tetris game. In our demo, we adopt [Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame](https://github.com/rajatdiptabiswas/tetris-pygame).

#### Launch Gaming Agent

1. Launch the game with
```
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame
python main.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è In your Tetris implementation, Modify game speed to accommodate for AI gaming agent latency. For example, in the provided implementation, navigate to `main.py`, line 23: change event time to 500~600ms.

You should be able to see:

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/tetris/gameplay.png" alt="tetris_game" width="400" align="center">
</p>

2. Adjust Agent's Field of Vision. Either full screen your game or adjust screen region in `/games/tetris/workers.py`, line 67 to capture only the gameplay window. For example, in `Python-Tetris-Game-Pygame` with MacBook Pro, change the line to `region = (0, 0, screen_width // 32 * 9, screen_height // 32 * 20)`.

3. Open another screen, launch your agent in terminal with one of the following commands:

```
# General Tetris agent (works with any supported model)
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/GamingAgent
python games/tetris/tetris_agent.py --provider anthropic --model claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219

# Claude-specific Tetris agent (optimized for Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
cd $YOUR_WORKPLACE/GamingAgent
python run_tetris_claude.py
```

#### Model-Specific Scripts

We provide specialized scripts for specific models to simplify running the game:

- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Use `run_tetris_claude.py` for optimized performance with Claude 3.7
  ```
  python run_tetris_claude.py [--cooldown 0.0]
  ```

- **Gemini**: Use `run_tetris_gemini.py` for Gemini 1.5 Flash
  ```
  python run_tetris_gemini.py [--cooldown 0.0]
  ```

- **OpenRouter (Claude 3.7 thinking)**: Use `run_tetris_openrouter.py` for enhanced reasoning with Claude via OpenRouter
  ```
  python run_tetris_openrouter.py [--cooldown 0.0] [--model anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet:thinking]
  ```

These scripts automatically configure the appropriate model settings and provide improved error handling.

#### Under the Hood: AI Vision Integration

The Tetris agent has been enhanced with improved vision capabilities:

- **Screenshot Processing**: The agent captures the Tetris game screen, encodes it to base64, and sends it to the AI model
- **Image Validation**: A robust validation system checks image integrity before sending to the model
- **Diagnostic Information**: The system provides detailed logging about image quality and dimensions
- **Fallback Responses**: If the AI model cannot process the image, the agent provides randomized fallback moves

#### Other command options
```
--api_provider: API provider to use.

--model_name: Model name (has to come with vision capability).

--concurrency_interval: Interval in seconds between consecutive workers.

--api_response_latency_estimate: Estimated API response latency in seconds.

--policy: 'fixed', only one policy is supported for now.

--cooldown: API cooldown in seconds (for specialized scripts).
```

#### Build your own policy

Currently we find single-worker agent is able to make meaningful progress in the Tetris game. If the gaming agent spawns multiple independent workers, they don't coordinate well. We will work on improving the agent and gaming policies. We also welcome your thoughts and contributions.

## Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Image Processing

We've recently improved the image processing pipeline with:

- **Robust Base64 Handling**: Properly handles images with or without data URL prefixes
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Provides detailed information about image dimensions, format, and content
- **Debug Image Saving**: Optionally saves processed images for troubleshooting
- **Model-Specific Optimizations**: Customized image handling for each AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)

### Model Provider Updates

- **Claude Integration**: Updated to work properly with Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- **Gemini Integration**: Fixed model name from "gemini-2.0-flash" to "gemini-1.5-flash" 
- **Error Handling**: Improved with randomized fallback responses when API calls fail
- **OpenRouter Integration**: Added support for Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking variant) and other models via OpenRouter

### Convenience Scripts

Added specialized runner scripts:

- `run_tetris_claude.py`: Optimized for Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- `run_tetris_gemini.py`: Configured for Gemini 1.5 Flash
- `run_tetris_openrouter.py`: Runs Tetris with Claude 3.7 Sonnet (thinking variant) via OpenRouter

These improvements ensure that AI models can properly "see" the game state and provide intelligent moves.
